# üìã Instructions for New AI Agents

## Copy-Paste Instructions for Any New Chatbot:

### **üéØ For VHA CDW SQL Help:**
```
Please read my SQL knowledge base at github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training 
before helping with this query. Start by reading AI-AGENT-START-HERE.md for 
navigation, then follow the decision tree to find relevant sections. Also 
review HIPAA-SAFETY-PROTOCOL.md for data protection requirements and 
AI-LEARNING-SYSTEM.md for how to save new discoveries.
```

### **ü§ñ For AI Learning Projects:**
```
I have an automated learning system for SQL development. Please:
1. Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training (start with AI-AGENT-START-HERE.md)
2. Follow the AI-LEARNING-SYSTEM.md protocol for this project
3. Create a new project folder in /ai-generated-queries/ with today's date
4. Save all query versions and document the development process
5. Ask for my approval before updating LESSONS-LEARNED.md with new discoveries
6. Follow HIPAA-SAFETY-PROTOCOL.md for any data protection concerns
```

### **üîç For Schema Discovery Help:**
```
Please read my VHA CDW knowledge base at github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training
Focus on:
- /examples/schema-discovery-queries.sql for systematic table exploration
- /schema/column-name-mappings.md for known VHA CDW column names
- /llm-training/sql-best-practices.md for cloud database requirements
Use the proven schema discovery approach before building any complex queries.
```

### **üö® For HIPAA-Sensitive Work:**
```
IMPORTANT: Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training first, especially 
HIPAA-SAFETY-PROTOCOL.md. Scan all content for potential HIPAA risks before 
processing. Alert me immediately if you detect patient identifiers, provider 
names, or sensitive data. I will make final decisions on data safety.
```

## üéØ **Short Version** (For Quick Use):
```
Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training (start with AI-AGENT-START-HERE.md) 
then help with VHA CDW SQL following the documented patterns and safety protocols.
```

## üì± **Mobile/Quick Version:**
```
Check github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training first for VHA CDW SQL patterns
```

## üîß **Specialized Instructions:**

### **For New Query Development:**
```
New SQL Project Protocol:
1. Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training (AI-AGENT-START-HERE.md)
2. Create project-YYYY-MM-DD-[description] folder per AI-LEARNING-SYSTEM.md
3. Use schema discovery approach from /examples/
4. Follow cloud DB requirements from /llm-training/sql-best-practices.md
5. Document all attempts and ask approval for lessons learned updates
```

### **For Troubleshooting Existing Queries:**
```
SQL Troubleshooting Help:
Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training focusing on:
- /troubleshooting/ folder for common error solutions
- /schema/column-name-mappings.md for known VHA CDW column issues
- LESSONS-LEARNED.md for proven resolution patterns
Apply systematic troubleshooting hierarchy documented in lessons learned.
```

### **For Power BI/Reporting Projects:**
```
VHA Reporting Project:
1. Read github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training (start with AI-AGENT-START-HERE.md)
2. Check existing query examples for similar reporting patterns
3. Follow VHA CDW best practices for data extraction
4. Create new project folder per AI-LEARNING-SYSTEM.md if developing new queries
```

## üéì **Training New Team Members:**
```
Team Member Onboarding:
Our SQL knowledge base is at github.com/BertMacklin87/SQL-agent-training
- Review README.md for overview
- Study LESSONS-LEARNED.md for proven approaches  
- Use /examples/schema-discovery-queries.sql for table exploration
